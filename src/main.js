/*
This is the digital component or boss part of our game, called 'A Journey of Fate.'
Some of the mechanics of the boss have not been added yet.  Such as declaring the move type before starting the players turn.
The code is very messy and no state Machines are implemented yet.
Any line of code that has the comment 'Not used' after it should be ignored, same with commented out code.

The starting scene is the menuScene, then travelerScene.  The order of the boss or changing of the scenes is travelerScene, belovedScene, bruteScene, and then dragonScene.
The player returns to the menuScene after beating all bosses.

Each scene besides the menuScene is a boss room, or level.
everyboss scene is coded very similar to each other, or the structure is the same but not the moves List and title.

Look at the menuScene or Menus.js first because is the starting screen.
